## Abstract
We’re in the midst of a big data revolution. Around the world 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is produced daily. That’s a mind-boggling amount. And how about this: approximately 90% of the world’s data was generated in the last two years alone. For years, companies have been collecting and analyzing massive amounts of information – everything from structured data on production, marketing, sales, HR, finance, facilities and operations to transaction-level data on suppliers, customers and partners. 
The explosion of data created has led organizations into a period of necessary innovation. The imperative to transform this data into intelligent insights has never been greater and no industry or line of business is immune from the big data revolution. It therefore comes as no surprise that Procurement is turning to big data to drive digital change [@fa18-523-86-www-Ariba-BigData].
Ariba was founded to solve the problem of inefficient enterprise procurement through the network, in 2012, SAP US acquired Ariba for $4.3 billion and was renamed SAP Ariba, right now, 2.9 million companies worldwide are connected using the SAP Ariba network platform, using Ariba's SaaS solution to manage expenses and business activities. SAP Ariba has built a complete corporate trading network.

## Architecture
Perhaps more than any other business unit, procurement stands at the forefront of digital transformation. What began as snatching efficiency gains by digitizing and automating paper-, time-, and labor-intensive processes has evolved today into real-time analytics, enterprise-wide visibility and global supply chain optimizations. By harnessing the transformative power of digitalization, procurement’s influence goes well beyond mere cost cutting and, today, profoundly impacts competitiveness and corporate strategy.
 
From sourcing and orders to invoice and payment, SAP Ariba's procurement solutions span the entire e-procurement process, and deliver serious bottom-line benefits:
*	60% lower operating costs
*	1% to 8% reduction in supply chain costs
*	50% to 75% faster transaction cycles
*	90% fully automated transaction processing
*	60% improvements in order accuracy
*	5% to 20% increases in revenue with new customers
*	30% or more higher share of wallet with current customers
*	15% improvement in retention rates among customers.

Automating key processes such as procurement, orders, invoicing and payment is a must if your business is to remain competitive. But to thrive, more must be done with the vast amount of data — internal and external — available to procurement.
Mining, cultivating and analyzing transactional and operational data —together with data from customers, prospects, partners, and suppliers — empowers procurement executives to gain visibility into direct and indirect spending across global accounts. This visibility empowers procurement pros to identify opportunities for consolidation, cost reduction, and process improvement, and, in line with procurements’ evolution to the role as trusted advisor, participate in more strategic and business-meaningful goals, such as discovering new business models, driving product and service enhancements, and identifying untapped revenue streams[fa18-523-86-www-Ariba-Procurement]. 

## Implementation
With B2B ecommerce adoption hitting an inflection point, companies operating global supply chains are moving away from legacy systems and expensive EDI (electronic data interchange) toward ubiquitous and affordable online platforms and cloud-based solutions that reduce costs, streamline procurement and payment processes, and provide visibility across global supply chains. Leveraging advances in cloud, mobility, big-data analytics and IoT, today’s digital supply chains are more data driven and operate faster, better, stronger, and leaner than ever before.
According to research presented in an INFOGRAPHIC created by The Economist Intelligence Unit, the gains from digital supply chains are impressive:
*	Today, 22% of manufacturing executives have “complete visibility” into their supply chains, up from 9% in 2013.
*	44% of senior executives say their supply-chain function uses sophisticated tools that leverage big data to help with day-to-day decision making.

Cloud-based supply chain solutions and business networks present great options for strategically tackling this problem by providing a robust, unified platform that enables close collaboration.
According to research by SAP Ariba, collaborative supply networks deliver quantifiable business value, including:
*	60% improvement in order accuracy
*	50% - 70% faster transaction cycles
*	More than 90% “touchless” transaction processes[@fa18-523-86-www-Ariba-Procurement].

Ariba can now integrate with solutions such as SAP ERP and S/4 HANA, and can use SAP HANA and SAP Leonardo technology for data analysis to provide customers with more insights. As SAP deepens the integration of Ariba with other software, users can more easily connect, share and query their own, partner ERP, CRM, SCM and e-commerce software.
Procurement systems capture a vast amount of data, including sourcing information, weather reports, manufacturing and delivery data, supplier data, purchasing data, catalogue data. There are undoubtfully very valuable insights within that data, but the challenge for procurement is to understand and use it to make better, informed decisions. Big data, predictive analytics and prescriptive guidance can further scale with cognitive computing power to provide better information that will enhance situational awareness and speed-to-decision. The resulting business value will improve the way procurement roles and processes are executed, making both more effective, valuable and sustainable[@fa18-523-86-www-Ariba-BigData].
The Ariba Procurement Content Solution has a single user interface and is integrated with the Ariba network, the world's largest online trading community, to quickly implement product catalogs and their maintenance. With the right contract pricing, users simply search for the content that the supplier provides about the goods and services they need. Users will also enjoy it when they use it, because this solution is designed to make users feel like they are shopping on their favorite websites. Once your e-procurement begins to include user-friendly content, you will be able to deliver on its promises of improved normative and bottom-line balances without any difficulty.


## Conclusion
Today, most procurement organizations are faced with three core challenges when working with big data:
*	Digitising processes: The first challenge for procurement is to access unstructured data that resides in scanned documents, email inboxes and spreadsheets. The key to unlocking the data’s potential is to ensure it is stored in a digital format that can be analyzed.
*	Driving insights: It is then vital to be able to analyses and utilize the digitized data. Human limitations, such as skills and time, as well as technical challenges can hinder find patterns, process the information intelligently and accurately, and derive insights. Customers are challenged to figure out how to tap into cognitive capabilities and build them into their processes.
*	Enabling talent and skills: Once this is in place organizations need to foster a change in culture and mindset that will help them embrace these disruptive technologies. Big data, predictive analytics and cognitive computing require new skills and new ways of working, such as self-service analytics.

Advances in technology and new concepts like intelligent computing fueled by SAP Leonardo provide ample opportunities to predict and respond more effectively to customer and market demands. This insight can guide buyers or requesters to create request for information or a contract template based on potentially unlimited amounts of information analyzed across multiple databases. Connecting people and information guided by “intelligent” procurement systems will fundamentally change how companies buy and sell[fa18-523-86-www-Ariba-BigData].
Conclusion
The digitalization of business is real, and it is here to stay. The combination of new technologies and skilled talent working with intelligent systems may provide the competitive edge that businesses need to stay ahead of competitors in the market. But it will also fundamentally elevate the importance of procurement to providing guidance on innovations, mitigating risks and securing a sustainable supply chain. As with any revolution there will be winners and losers and those that make the most of big data will come out on top.
